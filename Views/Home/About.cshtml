    <div class="AboutMe" valign="top">
        <p>
            My name is Jack Li and I am currently a third year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science (co-op) under the faculty of Mathematics.
            Through my co-op terms, I have been able to meet some really smart people and get involved some really exciting projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey started with Handrock Software Inc, a web development company that my father founded as a side-project. I took on development projects for a few of the clientele: WineDiva, WineScores, and MyGolfGroup,
            and discovered a love for web development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon after, I got an opportunity to work with Lixar IT as a Junior Developer for my first co-op term in Ottawa, Ontario for 4 months. I worked exclusively as a member of the Delphi Connected Car project,
            a product that allows customers to turn their ordinary cars with OBD2 ports into "Smart Cars". During my time at Lixar, I developed a FTP Account Management feature
            to allow clients to control the state of their user accounts by dropping files via FTP for the feature to process. Then, I worked extensively on the web portal to finish and deliver to our European and Chinese clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, I had a change of pace and took an opportunity to work as a Software Developer for International Medical Solutions(IMS), a small medical-imaging company based in Missisauga, Ontario. My role at IMS was to
            extend the existing Automated Testing and Build framework. During my time at IMS, I found many opportunities to improve the framework, and motivated me to perform a refactoring of the testing logic.
            My optimizations were able to reduce the testing time of continuous tests from 3 hours to 1 hour, and full-testing from 14 hours to just 4 hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most recently, I have worked as a member of the Windows Kernel Mode Graphics Driver team at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to deliver
            features for Radeon, FirePro and APU products. During my time at AMD, I was involved in solving last-minute showstopper issues for Windows 10, as well as issues in both Windows 7 and Windows 8. During my time here, I also developed a Windows GUI WinDbg launcher
            tool to help streamline the debugging process by allowing developers to have their commonly-used settings preconfigured. This tool is used widely in the AMD kernel team, internationally.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through each of my experiences, I have received only Excellent and Outstanding reviews from my supervisors. I hope to continue to challenge myself and push the boundaries of my knowledge by exploring areas 
            of software thatI have not yet had the chance to try. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As a software developer, I don't believe in finding opportunities that fit my skillset; I believe in expanding my skillset for new opportunities.
